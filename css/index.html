        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p class="code-skill-description">I still remember the first project that was created was a simple calculator which i created using C in the DS lab.Because the syllabus was too hectic i couldnt focussed much on Development but still i did a frontend project on building a GYM Website from code with harry youtube channel.Then i learned android development from the channel as well</p>

        <h3>Coding Skill</h3>
        <p class="coding-skill-description" >Being from a non-tech background it was quite hard for me to understand the languages initially, however after time i started learning coding from youtube and the first channel that i chose was University Academy. I chose this because his tutorials completely matched with my PPS Syllabus. Ifollowed this for a month but since the semester was i gave up after reaching the Ennum.Then our third semester started and realized the importance of C when Ma'am started teaching Datastructure. Without wasting much time i quickly completed C and then watched bunch of tutorails gor other languages.
          This was how i started coding. </p>
